# Gym Data Tracker (GDT)
## Description
 I am passionate about both coding and strength training and my goal is to design and build the perfect workout tracker. This is an open source project but I will review all pull requests and contributions.

## Design
GDT is a full-stack web application being built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). 
- Front End: The front-end is built using React, HTML and CSS.
- Back End: The back-end will be built using Node.js and Express. 
- Database: The database is MongoDB. 

## Deployment
The front-end and back-end will be separate projects that are deployed separately. 

## Goal Functionality

- [ ] View workout history
- [ ] Tracking of physical metrics such as body weight, body fat percentage, muscle size, etc.
