# Gym Data Log 

## Description
 I am passionate about both coding and strength training and my goal is to design and build the perfect workout tracker for someone who wants to monitor their strength development over time.
 
 Gym Data Log (GDL) is an open source project (MIT License) - I will review all pull requests and contributions.

## Design
GDL is a full-stack web application being built using the MERN stack. 
- Front End: React, HTML and CSS.
- Back End: Node.js and Express. 
- Database: MongoDB.

The stack is subject to change as the project evolves/grows.

## Goal Functionality

- [ ] Create, read, update, and delete workouts
- [ ] View workout history
- [ ] Tracking of physical metrics such as body weight, body fat percentage, muscle size, etc.
- [ ] Record and track goals for specific lifts or physical metrics
- [ ] View graphs of progress on specific exercises over time


## Roadmap
- [ ] Add New Workouts (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] View workout history (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Edit/Delete Workouts (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Authentication and user accounts
- [ ] Persistent storage for Workout Data
- [ ] Display progress over time (graphs and charts)
